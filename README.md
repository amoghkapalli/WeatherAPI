# WeatherAPI
This program takes one argument as a city and then connects to three different APIs to display a variety of information about the city.

On lines 16 and 17, enter your own [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com) and [OpenWeather](http://openweathermap.org) keys.

To build, run the following:\
javac -cp gson-2.8.6.jar *.java\
To run, type in the following command with your own city name replacing <city name>:\
java -cp .:gson-2.8.6.jar WeatherAPI <city name>
